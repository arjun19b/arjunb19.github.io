# Arjun K. Bhatia — Job Application Portfolio Website

This repo contains a GitHub Pages site that satisfies the **LMC 3403 Project 1** requirements.

## What’s included

- **Landing page** (`index.html`) with a 75–100 word bio, visuals (blob art, badges, KPI tiles), and clear CTAs.
- **Résumé page** (`resume.html`) with structured education, experiences, projects, and skills.
- **Showcase section** (`projects.html`) featuring two **professional documents** with explanations:
  - `docs/procedural-city.html`
  - `docs/spotify-stats.html`

The design uses lightweight, accessible HTML/CSS (no build step).

## Update content

- Edit your bio and tagline in `index.html`.
- Update résumé bullets in `resume.html`.
- Replace or expand the two documents in `/docs`. You can add PDFs and link to them as well.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public is simplest), for example `portfolio`.
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo (or push via git).
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) / root (`/`)
4. Click **Save**. GitHub will build and publish your site at the URL shown on that page.

> If you want a user site (e.g. `https://USERNAME.github.io/`), name the repository `USERNAME.github.io` and push these files to the `main` branch root.

## Checklist vs. Assignment

- **Part I: Website**

## Presentation prompts (3–5 min)

1. Who you are, professional interests, short‑term and long‑term goals.
2. Target role/org and quick analysis (values, what they seek, how your site maps to that).
3. Design/rhetorical choices (audience, structure, visuals).
4. Discuss each of the two documents and how they differentiate you.
5. Specific feedback requests.

## Customize the visuals

- Replace `assets/blob.svg` with your own graphic or photo.
